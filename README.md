## Idea

- Problem

Political party financing can distort the electoral process and is a major motive for
grand corruption. Such corruption is a significant problem in many countries including
both developed and developing countries. The particular pressures for corrupt financing
in developing countries are related to the lack of legitimate sources of finance, such as
business, trade unions and party membership, coupled with expensive and antidemocratic party activities, such as vote buying.

- What are we planning to build

A system where in all the transactions done by the political parties, happen through a block chain network.

Any donations or fundings given to the political parties are registered transactions in the network.

All the expenditure done by the political parties is also done through the same transaction system.

Thus by limiting all the online transactions of all the political parties to this block chain network we can find out the difference between the amout of money donated to the parties and the amount of expenditure done by the parties.
