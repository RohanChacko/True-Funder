## Idea

- Problem

Political party financing can distort the electoral process and is a major motive for
grand corruption. Such corruption is a significant problem in many countries including
both developed and developing countries. The particular pressures for corrupt financing
in developing countries are related to the lack of legitimate sources of finance, such as
business, trade unions and party membership, coupled with expensive and antidemocratic party activities, such as vote buying.
