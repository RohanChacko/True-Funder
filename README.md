## Idea

- Problem

Political party financing can distort the electoral process and is a major motive for grand corruption. Such corruption is a significant problem in many countries including both developed and developing countries.
The particular pressures for corrupt financing in developing countries are related to the lack of legitimate sources of finance, such as business, trade unions and party membership, coupled with expensive and anti-democratic party activities, such as vote buying.

- What are we planning to build

A system where in all the transactions done by the political parties, happen through a blockchain network.

Any donations or fundings given to the political parties are registered transactions in the network.

All the expenditure done by the political parties is also done through the same transaction system.

Thus by limiting all the online transactions of all the political parties to this block chain network we can find out the difference between the amount of money donated to the parties and the amount of expenditure done by the parties.

This transaction system will be enforced in the regular election commission machinery.

Thus, with this system all the transactions are recorded in a public ledger.

The difference between the expenditure and the earning of the party will thus help the public in making informed decisions regarding the transparency of transactions of the political parties.
